## In Class Assignment

Let's take a deeper dive into the datasets underlying *The Pudding* "Film Dialogue" article [https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/).

1. Create a new jupyter notebook and read in the three datasets from the Github repository [https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts/](https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts/) (I'll post the files in slack for easy download). Take a look at the documentation in the repository and discuss what you think each file contains.
2. Once you've loaded in the data into the notebook, discuss what data you think the columns contain and check if there's any missing data.
3. Try to answer the following questions:
   1. How could we tell if the amount of dialogue was increasing over time in movies? How might this influence the assessment about the breakdown of gender dialogue?
   2. How could test if there was any relationship between the film's gross value and the amount of dialogue in the film?

To answer these questions you'll need to merge, aggregate, and calculate some basic stats for these datasets.

*As a bonus, try creating a plot of visualize the answer to each of these questions.*
