#### Discussion about Methods and Data in DH

- Do you think humanists should understand methods they use? What might be some of the consequences if they don't? How does this relate to debates over data in DH?
- Do we understand what an algorithm *is*? How does Schmidt distinguish between *algorithms* and *transformations*? What were some of the critiques of Jockers' *syuzhet* package?
