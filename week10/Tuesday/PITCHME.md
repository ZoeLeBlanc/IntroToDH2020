### Today's Agenda

1. Discuss blog posts and making arguments with humanities data
2. Explore humanist listserv and continue data experiments
3. Updates and discuss timeline for final project

---
#### Making Arguments with Humanities Data

*Why is data analysis often seen as not new in the humanities?  What is confabulation? What is the value of showing blank plots?*

---
#### Making Arguments with Humanities Data

*What are the issues with descriptive statistics according to Weingart? How can we build from descriptive statistics? What are the two types of deviations Weingart lists and how can that help with analyses?*

---
#### Making Arguments with Humanities Data

*How do we create computationally tractable questions? What are issues with correlation and causation in humanities data analysis? What makes humanities data complex? Why is it difficult to test hypotheses? What are variables in humanities data analysis? How useful is it to test hypotheses in DH if there can be many different ones (i.e. Lincoln's example)?*

---
#### Making Arguments with Humanities Data

*What does Weingart mean with the idea of "narrative reconfiguration" rather than "description of the process"? How do we account for uncertainty in humanities data and does this relate to the issue of "ground truth"? How would you apply some of these recommendations to your own data analysis? What might you not apply?*

#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

- Walk through identify NER code
- Include comments for Jupyter notebooks
- Discuss what visualizations we could make
- What questions could we ask about this data?

---
#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

**Need to contextualize our data**

#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

Example 1: Julianne Nyhan "In Search of Identities in the Digital Humanities: The Early History of Humanist" [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280836611_In_Search_of_Identities_in_the_Digital_Humanities_The_Early_History_of_Humanist](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280836611_In_Search_of_Identities_in_the_Digital_Humanities_The_Early_History_of_Humanist)

#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

Example 1:

- Gives the history of the listserv, overview of the posts, and argues about the creation of disciplinary identity
- "Terms used to describe the group seem to signal how idealistic and personally involved a number of the early practitioners were. These included Suppor[t]ers of computing in the Humanities (Humanist 1:44); free people (1:80); true believer[s] (1:1035) and the lament “I thought we were all in this together” (1:661)"

#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

Example 2: Rockwell, Geoffrey, and Stéfan Sinclair. “The Swallow Flies Swiftly Through: An Analysis of
Humanist.” [http://hermeneuti.ca/swallow-flies](http://hermeneuti.ca/swallow-flies)

---
#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

Example 2:
- Does some text analysis of the listserv
- Compares DH to humanities computing, rise of the web, rise of software and social media discourses
- Makes an argument about hack vs yack

---
#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

Example 3: David McClure’s “Visualizing 27 years, 12 million words of the Humanist list” [http://humanist.dclure.org/](http://humanist.dclure.org/) and [http://dclure.org/essays/visualizing-the-humanist/](http://dclure.org/essays/visualizing-the-humanist/)

---
#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

Example 3:
- Using kde to compute patterns in text and compare the similarity in patterns. Finally use those similarities as edges in a network.
- 1980s computer hardware and textual studies
- 1990s increase in place names
- 2000s rise of administrative language

---
#### Experiments with Humanist Listserv Data

- So what should be our next steps with our dataset here?

---
#### Updated Expectations and Timeline for Final Project

- How much of your project will you reasonably have done by next Tuesday?
- Should we move the initial demo to a later date? And subsequently move the presentations into May?
