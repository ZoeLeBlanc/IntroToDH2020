### Today's Agenda

- Overview of Python Fundamentals 
- In-class exercises
- Project Managing Review Assignment and Final Projects

#### Python Fundamentals

Quick overview:
- How do we make a list?
- How do we make a dictionary?

---
#### Python Fundamentals

- How do we loop over lists?
- How can we print out each item in a dictionary?
(Try it out using last week's data!)

---
#### Python Fundamentals

- How can we only print out values in our loop if they match a condition?
- What are comparison operators?

---
#### Python Fundamentals

- How could we turn our loop and conditional code into something we could reuse multiple times?
- What is white space?

#### Project Management

**Overall goals for the end of the semester**
  
1) Have more in-depth knowledge of DH
2) Make a humanities data analysis project

---
#### Project Management

Some things that should happen in your final project:
- Either make or use an existing dataset, and explore it using code and data analysis methods
- Compare your results to either existing projects or ongoing broader questions (could be scholarly or pop culture)
- Present your insights using data visualizations 
---
#### Project Management

Some things that should happen in your review assignment:
- Select articles (or projects) that are relevant to your interests in DH/data analysis
- Compare and contextualize these materials (draw upon some of our discussions about DH as a field)
- Test out code if available, consider their arguments and provide critiques of what could be better or might be missing

#### Project Management

Thinking about final project and review assignment
Some questions:
1. What sorts of data are you interested in?
2. What datasets exist that you might want to use?
3. What humanities-area are you interested in? (We're defining humanities broadly in this class, so feel free to include anything relating to cultural change)
