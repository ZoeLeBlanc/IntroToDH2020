# Whiteboard Exercise

*Instructions:*
In pairs, write out step by step what you would have to do in a script to solve this problem. You can write code if you want, but feel free to just use words, arrows, symbols - whatever makes sense to you.

*Prompt:*
Hi! I'm a visiting scholar to UVA and interested in digital humanities? Can you help me figure out who I should work with?

I was hoping if I gave you a DH method, you could input it somehow and return the person/people who work in that field and all their information. If nobody does, let me know that too. 

Bonus would be if I could have multiple tries to input methods, just so I get a sense of what's possible in DH at the Scholars' Lab!

Thanks friend!
