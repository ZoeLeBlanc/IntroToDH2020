## First setup your computer

In the following sections, we'll go through how to get your computer set up so that you are ready for the course. Follow the instructions for your computer type (Windows = any computer running windows, Mac = any apple computer) Most of the instructions involve clicking on links to follow instructions and pasting text into your computer. If you get stuck or have any problems, please Slack me or email me.

### Windows

* Go to [Windows 10 Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
  
* Open your PowerShell as Administrator and paste this command and then hit enter:
  
```sh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

![Powershell](https://thewindowsclub-thewindowsclubco.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-to-open-an-elevated-PowerShell-prompt.jpg)

* Restart your computer when prompted.

* Install a linux distribution. Follow the steps for installing Windows Subsystem for Linux. (You can either do it through the Windows Store or the Command Line. I would recommend the Windows Store though). Choose the link for [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?rtc=1#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
* Finally initialize the linux distribution following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/initialize-distro)

#### Setup Python

* Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) comes with Python3, but need to install pip.
  
* Open WSL and type:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
```

* Then you need to install Debian development tools, openSSL, and Python extension headers. Type the following:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
```

* Then update pip:
  
```sh
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

#### Text Editor

* Finally, install Visual Studio Code for your computer (Select the Download for Mac or download for windows)[Find VS Code here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
