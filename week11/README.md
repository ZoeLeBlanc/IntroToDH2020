# Critiques of Digital Humanities


1. What are some of the critiques of DH in these articles?
    - Are there similar patterns?
    - How would you classify these critiques?
2. The articles mention Ted Underwood's work, do you agree with their critiques of his studies?
    - What do they get right about his work? What do they misunderstand?
3. How can we incorporate these critiques (or should we ignored them)?
    - How does this help us think about the limitations of digital research in the humanities (especially those using statistics)?
