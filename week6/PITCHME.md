#### Online Class

1. I will update course requirements to take into account the fact that we won't be face to face
2. I will do my best to transition to online, though this is new for me as well.
3. I will strive to be available online for both office hours, but also informal online chats.
4. I will make sure there's flexibility in the syllabus to account for family situations, shifting to working from home, new requirements in your other courses, etc...
