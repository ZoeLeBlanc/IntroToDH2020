### Assignment Outline

Your final presentation is worth 12.5% of your final grade. For the final paper of the project, you have a choice of either a final reflection paper or a blog post to be hosted on the CDH website.

The final reflection paper will be 4-5 pages double spaced and detail your experience of building the final project. This paper is a chance to critically reflect on what worked in your final project and what did not, as well as what you might do in the future with this project. Ultimately, the reflection paper is intended to be a chance for you to articulate what you learned about data driven research in the humanities. To that end, final reflection papers should reference at least four of the readings from class and detail how your project impacted your understanding of digital humanities. Final reflection papers are due by midnight May 12, 2020.

The blog post format covers some of the same material but is more focused on explaining your final project to a public audience. The blog post should cover some of the similar material from your presentation, mainly your research questions, rationale for your methods, and how you've interpreted your results. You should explain how you feel your project relates to discussions we've had in the class and reference at least two readings. The blog post will be at least 750 words but no more than 2000 words. Blog posts are also due by midnight May 12, 2020. However, because they are for a public audience, I will help you copy edit the final version and display your visualizations.
