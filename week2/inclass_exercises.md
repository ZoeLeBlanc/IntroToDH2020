*Few guidelines for working together*
- Finishing first doesn't matter, what matters is working together
- If you know the answer, give your partner a chance to work it out for themselves
- If neither of you know the answer, try reading the course materials and asking for help for the instructor

### Exercise 1

1. Create two variables containing strings. Decide how to name the variables
2. Check if the variables are equal to one another
3. Concatenate the strings.
4. Get the length of this new string.

**SWITCH**
Now next person types, other person decides what to type

1. Create two variables containing integers
2. Check if they are equal to one another
3. Multiply the integers
4. Add a float to this new integer
5. Check the type of this new integer

### Exercise 2

1. Create a python script using the Command Line. Call the script `new_script.py`.
2. Recreate the steps from exercise 1
3. BUT use the `input` method so that users can choose the initial values for both the strings and integers variables
4. AND use the `print` method to print out in the terminal each step of the exercise

### Exercise 3 (COMPLETE AT HOME)

Working in pairs or individually, figure out how to use the data types, structures, and methods we discussed to solve these prompts. Save your work in a script, titled `lastname_date.py` and send it before class on Tuesday.

1. Using the data with everyone's first name, create a data structure to hold these name and then add mine as well. Using print statements, display whose name comes first. Then change the order, and display whose name comes first after the change. Print the person's name who is at the end of the list, the person in the middle, and finally the first two names.
   Data:
   `Sara`
   `Kevin`
   `Shiva`
   `Anna`
   `Meher`
   `Maia`

2. Using the [Random Number Generator in Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator), generate ten numbers between 1 and 100. Calculate the average number for the group (hint: average is sum of all numbers divided by number of people in the group. You might check if Python has a built)
   Data:
   Type in [Random Number Generator into Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator) and generate ten numbers between 1 and 100

3. Create a data structure to store the table of top DH tools with their year and popularity count (Data from ["DH Tools Used in Research"](https://weltliteratur.net/dh-tools-used-in-research/)). Update the data structure to keep a count for overall (that is culminative) popularity of each tool over the five years. Print out the 2015, 2019, and overall values for each tool.
   Data:

| Tool        | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 
|-------------|------|------|------|------|------| 
| Python      | 9    | 22   | 27   | 32   | 35   | 
| JavaScript  | 8    | 18   | 12   | 6    | 15   | 
| Twitter     | 10   | 18   | 26   | 16   | 12   | 
| GitHub      | 2    | 6    | 17   | 5    | 10   | 
| Gephi       | 11   | 16   | 14   | 10   | 9    | 
| GeoNames    | 2    | 4    | 3    | 1    | 8    | 
| Transkribus | 0    | 1    | 2    | 1    | 8    | 
| Excel       | 5    | 9    | 3    | 6    | 7    | 
| MySQL       | 0    | 6    | 9    | 5    | 7    |
