### Assignment Outline

The second stage is worth 10%, and involves building the first iteration of the project to be presented to the instructor. You will demo the project and explain how much you have completed from the initial write-up. Then through feedback from the instructor and your peers, you will assess how much progress you have made and whether you need to change directions or revise any goals.
Detailed guidelines for the first demo For individuals plan to present for 10 minutes (15 minutes max), for groups plan to present for 15 minutes (20 minutes max).

Your presentation should:

- Introduce your project through summarizing your initial proposal (including your initial research questions, planned datasets, and methods)
- Demo your initial data collection through exploratory data analysis and give us a brief data biography of your dataset
- Outline what you plan to do next in the project and whether you need to change course from what you outlined in your initial proposal

### Assignment Rubric

*A/A+ Presentations*

- Presenters clearly outline the project, including detailed timelines, significance of their research questions, and rationale for their proposed methods.
- Presenters explain thoroughly what they have completed so far from their proposal and, with the exception of extenuating circumstances, the presenters also demo their initial exploratory data analysis. Presenters provide a thorough data biography of their datasets, as well as some interpretation of their initial results.
- Presenters present any obstacles they’ve encountered and how they plan to overcome them. Presenters detail next steps and how they plan to complete the remainder of their proposal.
- A+ presentations should be ones that go beyond the criteria listed here in some manner.

- Presenters explain what they have completed so far from their proposal, but have limited data to demo. Presenters provide some details about their datasets, but a number of questions remain
- Presenters present any obstacles they’ve encountered but are unclear how to overcome them. Presenters detail next steps but questions remain on how they plan to complete the remainder of their proposal.

*B/B-*

- Presenters outline their project, but lack significant details on their timeline, research questions, or methods. In particular, questions remain over the focus of their questions and what they are trying to achieve with the project.
