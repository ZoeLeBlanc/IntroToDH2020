@title[Foundations of Text Analysis in DH]

#### Today's Agenda

- Review homework assignment
- Review TF-IDF lesson
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Cleaning Data
- Making Hypotheses
  
---
#### Review of Homework

*Questions? Review of my solution*

---
#### Review of TF-IDF Lesson

*Questions? Did the lesson work? What is TF-IDF? What does it mean to vectorize a text? What are hyperparameters? Did you try TF-IDF with the Humanist dataset?*


---
#### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

*What is some EDA we might do with the Humanist dataset? What is Zipf's law?*

#### Cleaning Datasets

*What are some of the ways we can clean text? What interpretative choices must we make?*

---
#### Making Hypotheses


*What questions might we have about the Humanist listserv? What changed in DH discourses over this time period?*
