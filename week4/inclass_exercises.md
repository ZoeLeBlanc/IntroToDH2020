### Homework Time
This week's homework builds on classes, file input and output, and all your previous python exercises. Remember to ask for help if you get stuck, and that there's always more than one right answer!

1. Create a class for storing information about historical figures (i.e. people from history)

- Have the class store a first and last name
- Have a method in the class to return the full name

- Have the class store the person's relevant century **BUT** there's only a set series of options for centuries, which is the following:
```
centuries = ['long 19th century', 'even longer 18th century', 'Medieval Times', '1999']
```
- Have the class store the set options for centuries, and then have a method to check before adding a century if the century exist in centuries and only add it to the class if it's an accepted value.

- Have the class store the person's expertises
- Have a method that makes sure any expertise added to expertises doesn't already exist in expertises

- Have a method to return the person's class information to a dictionary (**hint** checkout the classes resources for help!)


2. Use your class to create three historical figures

3. print out all three figures information when you run the script

4. Write the historical figures information to a text file using the python `io` library.
