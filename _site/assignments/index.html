    <h2 id="in-class-participation-20">In Class Participation: 20%</h2>

<p>This grade is an evaluation of how much you engaged with both the course and your peers. Forms of participation include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participating during in-class discussion. This includes sharing ideas from the readings that you found particularly interesting or troubling, as well as posing questions about ideas or concepts you are working through</li>
  <li>Finding and sharing relevant materials, like recent articles or projects</li>
  <li>Pair programming (a concept described under Guidelines for Coding) and assisting one another with coding assignments
Providing peer review or feedback of each otherâ€™s work</li>
  <li>Visiting during office hours to discuss your projects and subjects of interest</li>
</ul>

<p>You are able to <em>drop your three lowest participation grades</em> and I will make available your weekly participation grade so that you can evaluate your performance.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-readings-and-assignments-15">Weekly readings and assignments: 15%</h2>

<p>Each week you will complete small assignments to help you engage with the readings and programming concepts. For weekly readings, you will be required to submit three questions in advance of class to the instructor via Slack. Please see Guidelines for Reading below for more about the strategy for reading and asking questions.
Potential questions to submit from readings include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did the arguments in each reading overlap? Were the arguments in opposition?</li>
  <li>What connections did you identify across readings?</li>
  <li>Was there aspects of the readings that were inspirational or infuriating? If so, which ones?</li>
  <li>What did you not understand in the readings? What was confusing?</li>
  <li>What do you want to learn more about?</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also have weekly programming assignments to complete and share either via Slack or Github. These assignments are intended to reinforce the lessons from our meetings and help you learn to work in pairs or small groups when coding.  Please see Guidelines for Coding below for more about policies for programming work.</p>

<p>Both reading responses and coding assignments will be graded as pass/fail, and extensions can be granted for the coding assignments but need to be requested prior to class.</p>

<h2 id="dh-review-assignment-20">DH Review assignment: 20%</h2>
<p>You will select two articles from Current Research in Digital History (https://crdh.rrchnm.org/
) and write a review comparing them. Drawing from readings in the class, you will situate the articles in broader trends in digital humanities. Your review should answer the following questions: 
What was the stated goals of the article? Was the article successful in achieving those goals? How would you evaluate their success?
How did each article integrate digital methods? Did they use similar methods or differing ones? 
What sorts of data did each article use? Did the authors define data in the same way?
How did the articles utilize visualizations for their arguments?
How do the articles relate to earlier trends in DH? 
Was the article authored by a team? Is the article part of a larger DH project? 
Ultimately, this review should go beyond summarizing the articles to exploring their scholarly contribution to digital humanities. When selecting which articles to review consider which areas of digital humanities interest you and that you might want to include in your research. The review should be between 2-3 pages single spaced (~1000-1500 words) and be <em>loosely</em> modeled on Reviews in DH format (i.e. focus on not just summarizing, but also contextualizing and critiquing these articles). You will need to get instructor approval of your articles before you begin working on the assignment.</p>

<h2 id="digital-humanities-project-45">Digital Humanities Project: 45%</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to expose you to how digital humanities research is created and evaluated. Working in groups OR individually you will select a humanities research question and relevant datasets. Example projects include exploring character networks in a set of novels to understand gender disparities, or correlation analysis of place names in historical documents to analyze spatial imaginings. Using your skills in Python and your knowledge of digital humanities, you will experience the lifecycle of a digital humanities project, from planning the project and collecting data to analyzing and communicating your results, and finally reflecting and outlining future directions.</p>

<p>The instructor will provide a list of available datasets and relevant readings that students can use as the basis for their project, but students are also encouraged to also develop their own datasets and research questions if they have a strong interest in a particular topic.</p>

<p>The first stage of the project is worth 10% and is your initial project proposal. If working as a group you will collaboratively agree on a project. Regardless, you will research and create an initial project write-up, answering the following: 
What are your initial research questions? 
What scholarship does your research draw upon and further? (This could be digital humanities scholarship, or broader questions in relevant humanities fields)
How you will translate your research questions into hypotheses? 
Which methods and datasets do you plan to use? 
How do you plan to communicate your results?
This write-up should be 2-3 pages and should lay the groundwork for the project, including a timeline to completion and how you plan to divide the work required to make the project.</p>

<p>The second stage is worth 15%, and involves building the first iteration of the project to be presented to the instructor. You will demo the project and explain how much you have completed from the initial write-up. Then through feedback from the instructor and your peers, you will assess how much progress you have made and whether you need to change directions or revise any goals.</p>

<p>The final stage is worth 20%, with the first 10% allocated to the public presentation of your project in our final class. The second 10% is an individual reflection piece (3-5 pages) on the experience of building the project, the successes and failures of the project, and your vision for the future directions of this project.</p>
