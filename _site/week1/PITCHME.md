#### What is Code?

Note: series of clocks/switches doing millions of computation. But how does it know what to do? We tell it with inputs! like a keyboard scroll down to keyboard visualization. But how does what we input turn into something the computer understands?

Note:
ones and zeroes
are how logic gates operate
but do we write in binary no?
Way of counting, just like our way of counting that uses the digits 0-9
Turns our commands into machine readable language

_Hardware_

Note:
talk a bit more about computers later
but main thing is that while technically you can 
Code is inert. How do you make it ert? Your goal is to turn your code into an explicit list of instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates, thus turning your code into something that can be executed—software.

_Programming languages_

Note:
A compiler is software that takes the symbols you typed into a file and transforms them into lower-level instructionsYou run software that transforms it into machine language. The word “language” is a little ambitious here, given that you can make a computing device with wood and marbles.

_Algorithms_

[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#what-is-an-algorithm](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#what-is-an-algorithm)

“Algorithm” is a word writers invoke to sound smart about technology. Journalists tend to talk about “Facebook’s algorithm” or a “Google algorithm,” which is usually inaccurate. They mean “software.”

Algorithms don’t require computers any more than geometry does. An algorithm solves a problem, and a great algorithm gets a name.

_Algorithms_

[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#what-is-an-algorithm](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#what-is-an-algorithm)

A programming language is a system for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application. It’s an algorithm management system. This is why, despite the hype, it’s silly to say Facebook has an algorithm. An algorithm can be translated into a function, and that function can be called (run) when software is executed. There are algorithms that relate to image processing and for storing data efficiently and for rapidly running through the elements of a list. Most algorithms come for free, already built into a programming language, or are available, organized into libraries, for download from the Internet in a moment.

#### What is Code?

- Code tells a computer a set of commands that you want the computer to execute |
- Code can be written in many different programming languages |
- Code is translated into binary through a compiler and a computer reads the binary |

#### What is Code?

Final exercise:
1. Discuss impact of code on society. How do we tell the history of code? What might the future of code look like?
2. Make a timeline of digital technologies in your life. What were the big turning points? What is your first memory? How do we decide an event is historic?
