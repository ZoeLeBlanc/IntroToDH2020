# CORN MAZE COMMAND LINE

1. First, using the command line commands and your terminal create a series of nested directories and files.

- At least one your directories needs to have nothing in it.
- At least one of your directories needs to have a file with the text, 'You're lost' on it.
- At least one your directories, needs to have a file with the text 'You've made it to the center of the maze!'

2. Once you've completed your corn maze, pair up with another student and have them try and navigate to the center of your maze using command line commands.
