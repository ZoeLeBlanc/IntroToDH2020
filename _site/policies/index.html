  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="communication-and-respect">Communication and Respect</h2>

<p>Outside of our meetings, course communication will primarily be through our Slack Channel on <a href="cdhprinceton.slack.com">cdhprinceton.slack.com</a>. Everyone will be setup and signed up with Slack during our first meeting, and the channel will be used for updates, sharing materials, and answering general questions. While Slack is great for streamlining emails, the platform is more informal and thus I ask that you remember to be respectful in your communications.</p>

<p>Respect is also crucial for our in-person class meetings. Digital Humanities is a broad field, and your fellow students will have differing backgrounds and perspectives. This diversity is one of the strengths of DH, but can also be difficult to navigate if you have not taken an interdisciplinary course before. I request that you each try to be inclusive and thoughtful in your communications, and if you ever have any concerns please feel free to contact me via Slack direct message or email.</p>

<p>In addition, I am always happy to talk in-person and I encourage you to visit my office hours. My office hours are Tuesday afternoons 4-5pm or Wednesday mornings from 9-10am, but I am also happy to meet at other times as requested.</p>

<h2 id="attendance-and-life-happens">Attendance and Life Happens</h2>

<p>Due to the breadth of DH subfields and methods, this course covers a wide range of materials in each of our class meetings. Students are expected to not only attend these sessions but also engage with course materials (more details in the participation section). However, life happens. You are permitted <strong>up to three absences</strong> at your discretion. Please come speak with me if you know in advance about these absences, since you will still be responsible for covering the materials you missed. Absences should generally be reserved for either schedule conflicts or illnesses.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of missing class because you are overwhelmed with your workload, please instead take an <em>information overload day</em>. On these days you will be excused from the assigned readings and in-class discussion. Instead you will be expected to actively listen to the discussion and then consult with the instructor about how to make up any relevant assignments at a later date. I realize the reading load and assignments for this course are significant and that you are balancing a number of other commitments at the same time, so information overload days are intended to help you manage your stress.</p>

<p>The idea for information overload days comes from Ryan Cordell’s <em>Building A Better Book Syllabus</em> <a href="https://f19bbb.ryancordell.org/policies/">https://f19bbb.ryancordell.org/policies/</a></p>

<h2 id="disability-accommodations">Disability Accommodations</h2>

<p>If you have a disability, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Services, you can find the relevant information at <a href="https://ods.princeton.edu/student-services/registration-and-self-identification">https://ods.princeton.edu/student-services/registration-and-self-identification</a>.</p>

<h2 id="workload-expectations-and-extensions">Workload Expectations and Extensions</h2>

<p>On average, you should plan to budget 3-5 hours for weekly readings and 2-3 hours for coding assignments. If you have concerns over the amount of assigned readings or any of the homework, please feel free to discuss them with me. If for whatever reason you need an extension, please come speak with me and we can try and arrangement depending on other assignments. I am always happy to extend due dates depending on your other commitments, but I also want to make sure that you are learning appropriate time management and project management skills.</p>

<h2 id="required-texts-and-resources">Required Texts and Resources</h2>

<p>Almost all the readings will be available online through either our course website or Blackboard, with the exception of Ted Underwood’s Distant Horizons: Digital Evidence and Literary Change (University of Chicago, 2019). The book should be available at Labyrinth Books across the street <a href="https://www.labyrinthbooks.com/product/9780226612836">https://www.labyrinthbooks.com/product/9780226612836</a> or on Amazon, etc.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-readings">Guidelines for Readings</h2>

<p>Assigned reading should be completed prior to a course meeting. Readings listed under additional readings are supplemental and are there if you want more information on the topic.</p>

<p>Questions to consider will completing the readings include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the main argument of the reading? Is there an argument? What is interesting or evocative or infuriating?</li>
  <li>How does the author support the argument?</li>
  <li>How would you connect the reading to previous readings?
Don’t focus on detailing everything the author says, but instead try to summarize in a few lines their central points and how they relate to the other readings from that week.</li>
</ul>

<p>For guidance on sample questions for weekly readings, please see the assignments guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-coding">Guidelines for Coding</h2>

<p>Coding assignments should be submitted via Github, unless indicated otherwise. Most coders work collaboratively, often engaging in pair programming, a method of talking through code problems together. This course encourages you to pair program and work together to learn from each other’s solutions. However, be aware that copying and pasting code might get you through one week, but the concepts in this course move quickly and build upon each other, so do your best to try and complete the assignments each week. Questions are encouraged both in person and online.</p>

<h2 id="academic-and-self-integrity">Academic and Self Integrity</h2>

<p>You are required to adhere to the Princeton University Honor Code <a href="https://ua.princeton.edu/contents/undergraduate-honor-system">https://ua.princeton.edu/contents/undergraduate-honor-system</a>. In short: don’t cheat. If you need help, see the instructor.</p>

<p>Depending on your background, you might have already covered some of the course materials earlier or have more aptitude for certain aspects of the course. I would encourage you to try and challenge yourself through either undertaking some of the additional readings and/or requesting more advanced coding assignments. Digital humanities is such a broad area of research that the sooner you take ownership for your learning, the further you will go.</p>
