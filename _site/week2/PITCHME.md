- What is a secondary source?
- What is McPherson's argument? How does she support her argument? What historical trends does she explore?
- What terminology did McPherson use? What is the idea of modularity?
- How does McPherson's vision for DH converge/diverge with Milic's?

"In short, I suggest that these two moments are deeply interdependent. In fact, they coconstitute one another, comprising not independent slices of history but instead related and useful lenses into the shifting epistemological registers driving U.S. and global culture in the 1960s and after.

Might we ask whether there is not something particular to the very forms of electronic culture that seems to encourage just such a movement, a movement that partitions race off from the specificity of media forms?"

Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman *Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery* (1974). 
"Used statistical analysis to argue that slavery in the nineteenth-century United States was both more profitable and more benign than previously thought. For many historians, Time on the Cross embodied everything that was wrong with quantitative history, from its reliance on limited datasets to its dismissal of less quantifiable aspects of history such as ideology or power."

"Conversations about merging ACH and ALLC began at Tuebingen, in a bar, in a conversation between Harold Short and me, in July 2002. A couple of months later, I had set a list called “adhoc”—allied digital humanities organizations committee), first message dated August 16, 2002. . . . We finally got things off the dime in Sweden, at the 2004 ALLC/ACH, and after waffling some more about names (ICHIO, OHCO, and others) we voted, in April of 2005, to go with ADHO, changing “A” from “Allied” to “Alliance.”

"The real origin of that term [digital humanities] was in conversation with Andrew McNeillie, the original acquiring editor for the Blackwell Companion to Digital Humanities. We started talking with him about that book project in 2001, in April, and by the end of November we’d lined up contributors and were discussing the title, for the contract. Ray [Siemens] wanted “A Companion to Humanities Computing” as that was the term commonly used at that point; the editorial and marketing folks at Blackwell wanted “Companion to Digitized Humanities.” I suggested “Companion to
Digital Humanities” to shift the emphasis away from simple digitization."
